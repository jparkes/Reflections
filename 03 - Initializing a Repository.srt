Thanks, Sarah.

0:00:01.240,0:00:03.500
Now once again, everything I'll be doing in this lesson,

0:00:03.500,0:00:05.140
I can do completely offline.

0:00:05.140,0:00:08.640
I won't internet access to create a repository or add commits to it.

0:00:08.640,0:00:10.540
That's why I'm here at the forest again.

0:00:10.540,0:00:12.950
First, I'm going to create a Git repository.

0:00:12.950,0:00:16.239
I can either do this in an empty directory and create files later or

0:00:16.239,0:00:19.520
I can create the repository in a directory that already contains files.

0:00:19.520,0:00:23.000
Right now, I'm going to use an existing directory with some recipes.

0:00:23.000,0:00:24.467
I'll run ls dash a.

0:00:24.467,0:00:26.770
And I can see that there are three recipes here.

0:00:26.770,0:00:30.330
A cake recipe, a frosting recipe and a chili recipe.

0:00:30.330,0:00:33.210
Notice that there isn't a .git directory because this isn't a git

0:00:33.210,0:00:34.760
repository yet.

0:00:34.760,0:00:38.800
Now I'll run git init, which initializes or creates a new Git repository.

0:00:38.800,0:00:40.980
Now if I run ls dash a again,

0:00:40.980,0:00:44.340
I can see that the .git directory has been created.

0:00:44.340,0:00:47.470
How many commits do you think the new Git repository contains?

0:00:47.470,0:00:49.210
Enter your answer in this box.

0:00:49.210,0:00:52.900
And recall that commit is a snapshot out of a Git repository.

0:00:52.900,0:00:55.250
If you're not sure how many commits it will contain,

0:00:55.250,0:00:58.280
then just pick a number you think is reasonable.

0:00:58.280,0:01:00.890
Next, what command could you use to find out the answer to

0:01:00.890,0:01:02.520
the previous question?

0:01:02.520,0:01:03.290
Here's a hint.

0:01:03.290,0:01:05.459
This is a Git command that you learned last lesson.
